# No Faces - A no face dating app.

### Introduction
---

We have all wanted to meet people with same interests (music, movies, etc.) and
hobbies as ours; to discuss, collaborate or simply have fun talking about them.
Of course, there are interest group/fan clubs on sites like Facebook and reddit, but
they are restricted to a single movie or an artist. What if you wanted to find an
identical twin of yours, someone who thinks like you, who shares similar likes as you
or have the same views as you. It could be a start of a great friendship or a birth of
new ideas.


This is where NoFaces comes in. NoFaces is an app where one can filter out people
based on their likes, dislikes, interests, political inclination, etc. , so that like-minded
people can come together, share their thoughts and discuss ideas. 

The main distinguishing feature of the app is that all of this is done behind a veil of
anonymity, profile pictures are not included, instead a randomly generated avatar will
be assigned, Hence the name, NoFaces. If the users prefer, they can share it later, in
private. With this users will focus more on interests rather than physical appearances.
